## 2026-02-24 — Strategic Repositioning: "Governance Layer" Framing

**Decision**: Reframe Project OS identity from "spec-driven scaffold" to "solo-developer governance layer for AI-driven development" across README, CLAUDE.md, design-principles.md, architecture.md, and project-os-guide.md.

**Context**: The "spec-driven" framing undersold the system's actual value. Project OS enforces phase checkpoints, adversarial quality gates, and human approval at every transition — that's governance, not just scaffolding. The "Bleeding-Edge" branding in project-os-guide.md was informal and undermined credibility. Version bumped to 2.1 to reflect the dashboard and governance narrative.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep current framing, add a "governance" section — rejected: additive bloat, doesn't fix the headline problem
- Full rename/rebrand — rejected: too disruptive, risks breaking @import references and external links

**Rationale**: Additive reframing: preserve all existing content and structure, replace only the positioning language. The five target files receive surgical edits; no file paths, skill identifiers, or structural elements change. The `spec-driven-dev` skill identifier is deliberately preserved (changing identifiers is a breaking change).

**Implementation note**: T15 triggered a fallback path — `grep "Type: Personal"` found 9 matches across scripts/docs (not just CLAUDE.md), so `Identity:` was added as a new field rather than replacing `Type:`. Post-review, `Identity:` was renamed to `Role:` to eliminate a nested naming collision with the `## Identity` section heading.
