# System Architecture

## High-Level Structure

Project OS is a solo-developer governance layer for AI-driven development, built on bash + markdown.
It preserves human authority through three mechanisms:
- **Phase checkpoints** — explicit human approval required at idea→design, plan→build (pm:approve), and build→ship
- **Quality gates** — adversarial review (3 isolated reviewers) before any feature reaches main
- **Audit trail** — ROADMAP.md state machine + JSONL activity log capture every decision

```

## Module Map

| Module | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Workflow commands | `.claude/commands/workflows/` | Spec-driven dev lifecycle (idea→design→plan→build→review→ship, mvp, compete, rebuild) |
| Tool commands | `.claude/commands/tools/` | Utility tools (dashboard, commit, handoff, catchup, research, metrics, kv, init, set-models, update, new-project) |
| PM commands | `.claude/commands/pm/` | Governance (prd, epic, approve, status) |
| Agent adapters | `.claude/agents/adapters/` | External-agent dispatch only — `codex.sh` (+ `INTERFACE.md`, `_prompt-template.sh`); default path is native Task-tool dispatch |
| Hooks | `.claude/hooks/` | Event-driven automation (11 files, see below) |
| Scripts | `scripts/` | Standalone utilities (see below) |
| Knowledge base | `docs/knowledge/` | Patterns, decisions, bugs, architecture, metrics, design-principles, roadmap-format, windows-bash-scanner, kv |
| Specs | `docs/specs/<feature>/` | Per-feature lifecycle docs (design, tasks, review) |

### Hooks (`.claude/hooks/`)

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_common.sh` | Shared utilities: path resolution, validation, JSON extraction |
| `compact-suggest.sh` | PostToolUse — warn when tool-call count suggests context is filling |
| `log-activity.sh` | Append structured JSONL events to the activity log |
| `notify-phase-change.sh` | Terminal/desktop notification on phase transitions |
| `output-index.sh` | PostToolUse advisory — index large tool outputs, hint via additionalContext |
| `post-mcp-validate.sh` | PostToolUse — validate Context7 MCP output (exit 2 / additionalContext contract) |
| `post-tool-use.sh` | Auto-format files after Write/Edit |
| `post-write-session.sh` | Scrub secrets from `.claude/sessions/` files after write |
| `pre-compact.sh` | PreCompact — auto-generate session handoff YAML (10-min debounce) |
| `session-start-setup.sh` | SessionStart — idempotent activation fallback: runs `setup.sh --check` so a cloned project installs its git hooks on first session |
| `session-start-maintain.sh` | SessionStart — auto-runs the maintenance loop once per `auto_run_hours` (policy, default 24h); drafts-only, debounced on ledger age, skips worktrees |
| `session-end-cleanup.sh` | SessionEnd — remove per-session counters, rotate append-only logs |
| `tool-failure-log.sh` | Log tool failures (timestamp + tool name only) |

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `audit-context.sh` | Estimate token cost of always-loaded context |
| `codex-review.sh` | Run a Codex code review via stdin piping |
| `context-filter.sh` | Intent-based filtering/indexing for large content |
| `create-pr.sh` | Generate a PR with AI-assisted description (gh CLI) |
| `dashboard.sh` / `dashboard-server.ts` | Cross-project status table / live SSE dashboard (port 3400) |
| `detect-stack.ts` | Deterministic stack detection (language/package manager/framework/test runner/formatter/database) from manifest + lockfile signals; JSON out, read-only, no repo code executed |
| `dream-accept.sh` | Accept a staged `/tools:dream` proposal: backup → swap → rebuild index → cleanup |
| `generate-manifest.sh` | Create `.claude/manifest.json` with sha256 hashes for update tracking |
| `install-global-commands.sh` | Install `/tools:new-project` globally |
| `install-hooks.sh` | Install git pre-commit/pre-push security-scanner hooks |
| `knowledge-index.ts` | FTS5 knowledge indexing and search (`node:sqlite`) |
| `lib/json.sh` / `lib/scan-rules.js` | Shared JSON helpers / scanner rule database (233 rules) |
| `lib/policy.ts` | Shared reader for `.claude/maintenance-policy.yaml` — flat `key: value` parsing kept in lockstep with `maintain.sh`'s `policy_raw_value` and `system-map.ts`'s `loadBloatThreshold` (no YAML library, linear-parse mandate) |
| `lib/skill-apply-lib.ts` | Pure proposal parser + anchored-op core for the skill-optimization loop — parses `## Run:`/`### Proposal N:` sections out of a skill-edit proposal doc and applies an anchored add/delete/replace to target-file content; no fs/git access |
| `lib/system-map-lib.ts` | Extractors + graph builder + readiness scoring for the system map |
| `maintain-draft.ts` | File a fingerprinted `[?]` draft into ROADMAP.md's maintenance-inbox section |
| `maintain.sh` | Deterministic maintenance loop — checks, drafts, ledger; never mutates canonical state |
| `memory-search.sh` | Full-text search across knowledge files |
| `setup.sh` | Idempotent project activation — installs git hooks + generates the initial map; run by new-project.sh, the SessionStart hook, and once per clone; `--adopt` runs hook install in quarantine mode (`--no-chain`) for in-place adoption targets |
| `lib/project-root.ts` | Shared project-root resolution (imported by knowledge-index/system-map/maintain-draft) |
| `new-project.sh` | Bootstrap a new Project OS project, or adopt Project OS in place into a pre-existing repo via `--adopt <target-dir>` (two-class collision policy, orphan quarantine, `--dry-run` plan preview) |
| `observation-parser.ts` | Extract 5 typed observations from tool output (sensitive-key denylist) |
| `scrub-secrets.sh` | Scrub secret patterns from a file (delegates to scanner) |
| `security-scanner.ts` | Zero-dep secrets/PII scanner (8 subcommands) |
| `skill-apply.ts` | Anchored apply engine for skill-edit proposals — standard tier via `/pm:approve`, plus a narrow `--auto` tier gated by six deterministic conditions (policy flag, delete/replace only, `.claude/commands/`/`.claude/skills/` containment, non-increasing size, live `system-map.ts` dangling-ref evidence, edit-content correspondence) |
| `skill-ledger.ts` | Sole sanitizing writer for `docs/knowledge/skill-edit-rejections.md` — one entry per rejected skill-edit proposal (fingerprint, summary, reason), fixed-string dedup, atomic write |
| `sync-hooks.sh` | Sync hooks from the template to a target project |
| `system-map.ts` | Generate/check/report the framework wiring map (`docs/maps/`) |
| `update-project.sh` | Check for and apply Project OS updates from upstream; `--local-upstream <dir>` sources the template from a local directory instead of a `gh` release, for offline updates and offline testing of the classification loop |
| `validate-freshness.sh` | Wrapper for knowledge-index freshness validation |
| `validate-roadmap.sh` | Validate ROADMAP.md format, deps, cycles, consistency |

## Data Flow

### Build Phase
```
ROADMAP.md ──parse──→ Native Tasks (addBlockedBy) ──dispatch──→ Sub-agents (worktree isolation)
     │                      │                                        │
     ▼                      ▼                                        ▼
Governance record     Dispatch Resolution                   Completion Reports
(markers win)      (model→agent→native default)              (per-task output)
     │                                                               │
     └──────────── Batch-Drain Consistency Check ◄───────────────────┘
```

### Dispatch Resolution (3-step)
0. `(model: <model>)` annotation → native Task-tool dispatch with that model
1. `(agent: codex)` annotation → external adapter (if healthy, else native)
2. Default → native Task-tool dispatch with sub-agent default model (settings.json)

### Dashboard (optional)
```
ROADMAP.md ──fs.watch──→ dashboard-server.ts ──SSE──→ Browser
activity.jsonl ─────────────┘         │
                                      ├── /api/status (HTML)
                                      ├── /api/dag (Mermaid)
                                      ├── /api/activity (HTML)
                                      ├── /api/kanban (HTML — Board tab, columns per lifecycle marker)
                                      └── /api/status.json (JSON)
```

## Context Filtering &amp; Knowledge Index

Project OS includes an FTS5-based knowledge index for efficient context management:

- **Index engine**: `scripts/knowledge-index.ts` — uses `node:sqlite` FTS5 (Node 22.16+, zero deps)
- **Subcommands**: `index`, `index-vault`, `index-observations`, `search`, `rebuild`, `stats`, `stale`, `config`
- **Observation parser**: `scripts/observation-parser.ts` — extracts 5 typed facts (error-pattern, file-relationship, config-key, function-sig, dependency-chain) with sensitive key denylist; unit-tested in `tests/observation-parser.test.ts` (31 tests), including a dedicated secret-denylist guard test
- **Filter script**: `scripts/context-filter.sh` — routes large outputs through intent-based filtering
- **Advisory hook**: `.claude/hooks/output-index.sh` — indexes large tool outputs and persists extracted observations to `observation_meta` table
- **Auto-checkpoint hook**: `.claude/hooks/pre-compact.sh` — PreCompact hook auto-saves session state before context compaction (10-min debounce)
- **SKILL**: `.claude/skills/context-filter/SKILL.md` — teaches proactive routing for large content

### Recency-Weighted Search

Search results use composite scoring that blends FTS5 text relevance with access patterns:
```
composite_score = (fts5_rank * 0.7 + log(access_count + 1) * 0.3) * recency_decay
recency_decay = 0.5 ^ ((now - last_accessed) / recency_halflife_days)
```
- `access_count` and `last_accessed` are tracked per source in `index_meta`
- `recency_halflife_days` defaults to 14 (configurable in `settings.json`)
- Use `--obs-type TYPE` to filter search by observation type (e.g., `--obs-type error-pattern`)

### Freshness System

Content freshness is tracked with three confidence levels:
- **high**: Has `date:` field in YAML frontmatter
- **medium**: Dated via git history
- **low**: Dated via file modification time only

Content older than 90 days without validation is marked `[STALE]` in search results.
Use `node scripts/knowledge-index.ts validate <source>` to reset the stale clock.

## Security Scanning

Defense-in-depth secret detection with three enforcement layers:

- **Scanner engine**: `scripts/security-scanner.ts` — zero-dep Node.js scanner with 8 subcommands (scan-files, scan-staged, scan-diff, scrub, list-rules, test-rules, test-pattern, install-hooks)
- **Rule database**: `scripts/lib/scan-rules.js` — 233 rules (219 ported from gitleaks@256f6479, 14 custom PII/privacy). ESM module, keyword pre-filter, Shannon entropy detection (threshold 4.5)
- **Allowlist**: `.claude/security/allowlist.json` — path ignores, rule disables, inline `// scan:allow` suppression, stopwords
- **Hook chain**: pre-commit (scan-staged) → pre-push (scan-diff) → ship workflow step 1.5 (scan-diff against base)
- **Scrub mode**: `scrub-secrets.sh` delegates to scanner's `scrub` subcommand (atomic temp+rename), with inline bash fallback when Node unavailable
- **Hook installer**: `scripts/install-hooks.sh` — validates rules, writes pre-commit and pre-push hooks to `.git/hooks/`

Shell safety: all git operations use `execFileSync("git", [args])` (no string templates). Path traversal guard on all user-supplied paths.

## Self-Maintenance

Five zero-npm-dep components, strict authority split: deterministic code heals generated artifacts; only `/pm:approve` and `/tools:dream-accept` mutate canonical state.

- **System map** (`system-map.ts` + `lib/system-map-lib.ts`) — wiring graph (hooks/commands/skills/scripts/libs) → `docs/maps/`, with readiness findings (orphans, unwired hooks, dangling refs, manifest gaps, bloat).
- **Pre-commit auto-heal** — hook runs `system-map.ts precommit` after `scan-staged`; on drift, regenerates from the git index (not the working tree), stages `docs/maps/`, re-scans it. Fails only on generator/scan error.
- **Dream pass** (`/tools:dream`, `/tools:dream-accept`) — stages consolidation under `docs/memory/.dream-output/`; accept backs up to `docs/memory/.archive/`, swaps in, rebuilds the index.
- **Maintenance loop** (`maintain.sh` + `maintain-draft.ts`) — LLM-free; runs map / staleness / failures / consolidation / search-miss checks (the last driven by `knowledge-index.ts` search-log instrumentation at `.claude/logs/search-log.jsonl`), files fingerprinted `[?]` drafts + a ledger line. Reads `.claude/maintenance-policy.yaml`, never writes it.
- **Reflection loop** (`/tools:reflect` + `skill-apply.ts` + `skill-ledger.ts`) — three triggers fire it: `/workflows:ship`'s Post-Ship step 6, a `/workflows:review` gate-FAIL, and both `/workflows:rebuild` modes (logging a `rebuild-triggered` activity event). `/tools:reflect` scopes to the feature's in-play instruction files, reads trigger-specific evidence, loads negative feedback from `docs/knowledge/skill-edit-rejections.md` (in-scope entries + the 10 most recent, capped to bound injection) plus `maint-fp: skill-edit:` lines in ROADMAP.md, and emits at most 3 bounded, anchored, evidence-backed proposals to `docs/specs/<feature>/skill-edits.md` — "0 proposals" is a legitimate outcome, never padded to fill the budget. Every proposal files as a `[?]` draft through `maintain-draft.ts`, gated by `/pm:approve` (which displays the proposal text and, on approval, runs a staged apply via `skill-apply.ts`; on rejection, records the reason via `skill-ledger.ts` and retires the draft in place). The only autonomy exception is a narrow `--auto` tier in `skill-apply.ts`, restricted to the dead-reference-fix class and gated by the `skill_auto_apply` policy flag (default off): each of its six conditions is checked against live platform state, never the proposal's own claims, and a successful auto-apply still lands as a separate, individually revertible commit carrying the full proposal block in the commit body, plus a retroactive `[?]` acknowledgement draft through the normal `/pm:approve` gate. Everything outside that class stays draft-only.

Locations: `docs/maps/`, `.claude/maintenance-policy.yaml`, `.claude/logs/maintenance-ledger.jsonl` (rotated, gitignored), `docs/knowledge/skill-edit-rejections.md`.
